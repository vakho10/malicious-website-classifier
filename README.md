## üîç Making Predictions

### Graphical User Interface (Recommended)

**Launch the GUI application:**
```bash
python gui.py
```

**Features:**
- üñ•Ô∏è User-friendly graphical interface
- üìä Detailed analysis with color-coded results
- üéØ Real-time feature breakdown and explanations
- üí° Safety recommendations based on analysis
- ‚ö° Asynchronous processing (non-blocking UI)

**How to use:**
1. Launch the application with `python gui.py`
2. Wait for the model to load (shows in status bar)
3. Enter a URL in the input field
4. Click "Analyze" or press Enter
5. View detailed results with feature explanations

### Command Line Interface

**Single URL:**
```bash
python predict.py https://google.com
```

**Multiple URLs:**
```bash
python predict.py https://google.com http://suspicious-site.com https://github.com
```

### Expected Output Example
```
Loading model from phishing_model.h5...

Analyzing: https://google.com
  Features: {'SFH': 1, 'popUpWindow': 1, 'SSLfinal_State': 1, ...}
  ‚Üí LEGITIMATE (confidence: 0.987)

Analyzing: http://paypal-verify-account.tk
  Features: {'SFH': 0, 'popUpWindow': 0, 'SSLfinal_State': -1, ...}
  ‚Üí PHISHING (confidence: 0.969)

============================================================
SUMMARY
============================================================
https://google.com: LEGITIMATE (98.7%)
http://paypal-verify-account.tk: PHISHING (96.9%)
```

### Understanding the Feature Output

When analyzing a URL, you'll see 9 feature values:

```
Features: {
  'SFH': 1,                    # Safe form handler (same domain)
  'popUpWindow': 1,            # No suspicious popup JavaScript
  'SSLfinal_State': 1,         # Valid HTTPS certificate
  'Request_URL': 1,            # Resources loaded from same domain
  'URL_of_Anchor': -1,         # Many external links (suspicious)
  'web_traffic': 1,            # Site responds and has traffic
  'URL_Length': 1,             # Short URL (< 54 characters)
  'age_of_domain': 0,          # Domain age unknown or 0-1 years
  'having_IP_Address': 1       # Uses domain name (not IP)
}
```

**Feature Interpretation:**
- **1** = Safe/Legitimate indicator
- **0** = Neutral/Unknown/Mixed
- **-1** = Suspicious/Phishing indicator

The model uses all 9 features together to make a final prediction. A mix of good and bad features can result in moderate confidence scores (60-80%).

### Python API

```python
from phishing_detector import PhishingDetector

# Load trained model
detector = PhishingDetector.load()

# Predict single URL
results = detector.predict_urls(['https://example.com'])

# Access results
for result in results:
    print(f"URL: {result['url']}")
    print(f"Prediction: {result['prediction']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2%}")
    print(f"Probabilities: {result['probabilities']}")
```

## üß™ Testing Different Scenarios

### Legitimate Sites (Expected: LEGITIMATE)
```bash
python predict.py https://google.com https://github.com https://wikipedia.org
python predict.py https://microsoft.com https://apple.com https://stackoverflow.com
```

**Expected Results:**
- High confidence for LEGITIMATE classification
- Features show: valid SSL, safe forms, same-domain resources
- Good web traffic indicators

### Suspicious/Phishing Sites (Expected: PHISHING)
```bash
# Suspicious domain patterns (common phishing tactics)
python predict.py http://paypal-verify-account.tk http://secure-login-amazon.xyz

# No HTTPS (security red flag)
python predict.py http://update-account-now.info

# Very long URLs (obfuscation technique)
python predict.py http://example.com/verify/account/security/update/confirm/payment/details/now/click/here
```

**Expected Results:**
- High confidence for PHISHING classification
- Features show: no SSL, suspicious forms, external resources
- Domain patterns mimicking legitimate brands

### Special Cases & Edge Cases

#### Private/Local IP Addresses
```bash
python predict.py http://192.168.1.1/login http://10.0.0.1/admin
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitation:** Private IPs (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x) may be classified as LEGITIMATE even though using IP addresses is a phishing indicator. 

**Why this happens:**
- Private IPs are typically router admin panels or local devices
- They respond normally and have working HTML/forms
- The training dataset (from 2016) contained mostly public internet URLs
- Only the `having_IP_Address = -1` feature flags it as suspicious
- Other features appear normal (functioning web server, safe forms)
- The model needs **multiple** suspicious signals to classify as phishing

**Real-world context:** Legitimate users accessing `192.168.1.1` are configuring their home router, not being phished. However, a phishing email with `http://192.168.1.1` would be suspicious since victims can't reach private IPs from the internet.

#### Domain Age Testing
```bash
# Very new domains (often used for phishing)
python predict.py http://brand-new-site-2024.com

# Established domains
python predict.py https://cnn.com https://bbc.com
```

**Note:** WHOIS queries may timeout (3-5 seconds). If domain age cannot be determined, the feature defaults to 0 (unknown), which slightly favors phishing classification.

#### Mixed Security Indicators
```bash
# HTTPS but suspicious domain
python predict.py https://secure-paypal-login-verify.xyz

# HTTP but otherwise legitimate-looking
python predict.py http://old-news-site.com
```

**What to expect:** The model weighs multiple features. A site with HTTPS but a suspicious domain name might still be flagged as phishing if other indicators (external anchors, suspicious forms) are present.

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Custom Training Parameters

Edit `config.py`:
```python
# Training configuration
TEST_SIZE = 0.2          # 20% test split
EPOCHS = 100             # Maximum epochs
BATCH_SIZE = 32          # Batch size
LEARNING_RATE = 0.001    # Adam optimizer learning rate
PATIENCE = 10            # Early stopping patience
```

### Feature Extraction Only

```python
from feature_extractor import FeatureExtractor

# Extract features without prediction
features = FeatureExtractor.extract('https://example.com')
print(features)
```

### Batch Prediction

```python
from phishing_detector import PhishingDetector
import pandas as pd

detector = PhishingDetector.load()

# Read URLs from file
urls = pd.read_csv('urls.csv')['url'].tolist()

# Predict all
results = detector.predict_urls(urls)

# Save to CSV
pd.DataFrame(results).to_csv('predictions.csv', index=False)
```

## üìà Model Performance

### Training Results

After running `python train.py`, you should see results similar to:

```
=== EVALUATION ===
Test Loss: 0.2680, Accuracy: 0.9041

Confusion Matrix:
              Predicted
              Legit  Phishing
Actual Legit    119     11
Actual Phishing  15    126

Classification Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
  Legitimate       0.89      0.92      0.90       130
    Phishing       0.92      0.89      0.91       141
    accuracy                           0.90       271
```

**Performance Metrics Achieved:**
- **Overall Accuracy:** ~90% on test set
- **Precision (Phishing):** 92% - When model says "phishing", it's correct 92% of the time
- **Recall (Phishing):** 89% - Model catches 89% of actual phishing sites
- **F1-Score:** 0.91 - Balanced performance metric

### Confusion Matrix Interpretation

|                | Predicted Legitimate | Predicted Phishing |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Actual Legitimate** | 119 (True Negative) | 11 (False Positive) |
| **Actual Phishing**   | 15 (False Negative) | 126 (True Positive) |

**Key Insights:**
- **11 False Positives:** Legitimate sites incorrectly flagged as phishing (8% error rate)
- **15 False Negatives:** Phishing sites missed by the classifier (11% miss rate)
- **Goal:** Minimize false negatives (missed phishing) while keeping false positives low

### Real-World Performance

Based on testing with live URLs:

‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Accurately identifies suspicious domain patterns (paypal-verify, secure-login-bank)
- Detects missing HTTPS on login/payment pages
- Recognizes external resource loading (common in phishing kits)
- Fast predictions (~2-5 seconds per URL including feature extraction)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations:**
- May misclassify new legitimate domains (<1 year old)
- Private IP addresses (192.168.x.x) can bypass detection
- Requires working internet connection for feature extraction
- WHOIS timeouts default to "unknown" domain age

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

1. **Feature Extraction Dependencies**
   - Requires network access to analyze live URLs
   - WHOIS queries may timeout for some domains
   - SSL checks require HTTPS connectivity

2. **Model Constraints**
   - Trained on 2016 dataset patterns (1,353 samples from UCI repository)
   - May not detect newest phishing techniques
   - Performance depends on feature quality and network conditions
   - **Private IP addresses** (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x) may not be flagged correctly as they respond locally

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Analyzing many URLs may trigger rate limits
   - WHOIS queries can be slow (3-5 seconds per domain)

4. **False Positives/Negatives**
   - Legitimate sites with poor SSL may be flagged
   - New domains (<1 year) scored lower
   - Sites with many external resources may be suspicious
   - Local/internal IPs may bypass some checks

5. **Dataset Limitations**
   - Only 9 features used (reduced from 30+ in original dataset)
   - Binary classification only (no confidence gradations)
   - Historical data may not reflect current phishing tactics
